'''
Your goal will be to use this data to predict the life expectancy in a given country based on features such as the country's GDP, fertility rate, and population.
Since the target variable here is quantitative, this is a regression problem. To begin, you will fit a linear regression with just one feature: 'fertility', which is the average number of children a woman in a given country gives birth to. In later exercises, you will use all the features to build regression models.

Before that, however, you need to import the data and get it into the form needed by scikit-learn. This involves creating feature and target variable arrays. Furthermore, since you are going to use only one feature to begin with, you need to do some reshaping using NumPy's .reshape()
'''

# Import numpy and pandas
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')

# Create arrays for features and target variable
y = df['life'].values
X = df['fertility'].values

# Print the dimensions of X and y before reshaping
print("Dimensions of y before reshaping: {}".format(y.shape))
print("Dimensions of X before reshaping: {}".format(X.shape))

# Reshape X and y
y = y.reshape(-1,1)
X = X.reshape(-1,1)

# Print the dimensions of X and y after reshaping
print("Dimensions of y after reshaping: {}".format(y.shape))
print("Dimensions of X after reshaping: {}".format(X.shape))

#explore the DataFrame using pandas methods such as .info(), .describe(), .head()
